## Fundamentals of Go Tasks

### Task: Student Grade Calculator

This task involves creating a Go console application that allows students to calculate their average grade based on different subjects.

#### Requirements:
- **Input**:
  - Prompt the student to enter their name.
  - Ask for the number of subjects they have taken.
  - For each subject, collect the subject name and the grade obtained (numeric value).
- **Output**:
  - Display the student's name.
  - Show individual subject grades.
  - Calculate and display the average grade.

#### Implementation Details:
- Use variables and data types to store student data.
- Use conditional statements to validate input (e.g., ensure grade values are within a valid range).
- Implement loops to handle multiple subjects and grades.
- Utilize collections (e.g., List, Dictionary) to store subject names and corresponding grades.
- Define a method to calculate the average grade based on the entered grades.
- Use string interpolation to display the results in a user-friendly format.
- Optionally, write tests for the code to ensure correctness.

This task is designed to strengthen your understanding of Go fundamentals, including variables, loops, conditionals, and collections.
